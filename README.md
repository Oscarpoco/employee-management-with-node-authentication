# Employee Management System - Gamefusion

This project is an **Employee Management System** built using a **Node.js** backend with **Express.js** and a **React.js** frontend. The backend interacts with **Firebase Firestore** for employee data management, and the frontend allows users to interact with the system via a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- Add a new employee
- Check if an employee already exists (by email, ID number, or phone number)
- Get all employees
- Update employee details
- Delete an employee and move them to the `deleted_employees` collection
- Get all deleted employees
- User-friendly React frontend for managing employees
